How to update the Sling website
-------------------------------

INTRO
-----
The http://sling.apache.org/ website is managed by the ASF CMS
(http://cms.apache.org).

All Sling committers have read-write access to the website content,
but it's good practice to discuss big changes on the dev list in advance.

Content is provided in markdown structured text format, see cms.a.o for
pointers to syntax and conventions.

See also http://wiki.apache.org/general/ApacheCms2010 for help and links.

WORKING IN SVN
--------------
Committing content under
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/site/trunk/
causes a staging build of the website to be executed.

The staged content becomes available under 
  http://sling.staging.apache.org/

The build process can be followed at 
  http://ci.apache.org/builders/sling-site-staging

See the existing content for how to add images and additional files.

To push the changes in production, connect to
https://cms.apache.org/sling/publish with your LDAP credentials (as set
on people.apache.org).

BROWSER-BASED EDITING AND PUBLISHING
------------------------------------
Starting at https://cms.apache.org/sling/ , one can get a working copy, 
edit it if needed (with simple preview) and publish it to the live site.

THAT'S IT
---------
The Apache CMS is a simple tool compared to some of the CMS we're used to.

The nice thing is that the workflow happens in svn, so it's no different
than what we do for code.

Enjoy.
