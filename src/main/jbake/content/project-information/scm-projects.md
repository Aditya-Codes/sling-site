# Repository information

Both the Github and ASF's Gitbox Sling repositories contain the latest version of Sling. Gitbox is being executed in the multi-master mode, i.e. each commit landing in the Github repo ends up in Gitbox and vice-versa.

# How to contribute

## Non-Committers

Please fork the according repository from Github and then create a [Pull-Request from the fork towards the original repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). Please make sure to also open an accompanying issue in  the [Sling issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SLING).

## Committers

Either use the Github or the Gitbox URL to clone the repository. Then just commit and push. For pushing to the ASF Gitbox use the Apache LDAP user and password with https. Further information is available at [Committer's documentation](https://reference.apache.org/committer/git).

To be able to directly push to the Github repo you must [link your Github account with your Apache account](https://gitbox.apache.org/setup/).
