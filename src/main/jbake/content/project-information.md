## Mailing Lists

These are the mailing lists that have been established for this project. For each list, there is a subscribe, unsubscribe, and an archive link.

The Sling Users List is the preferred way of getting help with Sling. However, you can also [Ask a Sling question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=sling) if you prefer.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses JIRA a J2EE-based, issue tracking and project management application. Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following issue tracking system for this project.

The issue tracker can be found at [http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING)

## Source Repository

This project uses Git to manage its source code. The source code is hosted on the [ASF GitBox setup](https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf)
and replicated to [Apache organisation on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/). As a developer you may push to either GitBox or GitHub. Note however that for GitHub to work you need to set up your GitHub account with two-factor authentication from [the main GitBox page](https://gitbox.apache.org/).

To check out the Sling source code, see the instructions from  [Getting and building Sling](/documentation/development/getting-and-building-sling.html#getting-the-sling-source).

### Web Access

The source code can be accessed using either the GitHub or GitBox setup, but the most convenient way is to use the GitHub
search to display all Sling projects: [https://github.com/apache/?q=sling](https://github.com/apache/?q=sling).

### Attic
A number of Sling modules that are not being developed further have been moved to the [Sling Attic](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/sling/attic/) in the svn
repository that we used until late 2017.

Now that the Sling codebase is split in multiple Git repositories, we'll probably keep such modules in place but mark them as being retired. We haven't had such
a case since the move to Git, we will clarify once that happens.

## Continuous Integration

Sling builds run automatically on the [ASF's Jenkins instance](https://builds.apache.org/), triggered
by commits.

We maintain multiple build jobs, typically one or two per module. These are grouped into two views:

* [Sling](https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling/), which holds all Sling-related jobs
* [Sling-Dashboard](https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling-Dashboard/), which holds all Sling jobs needing attention, such as failed jobs.

More documentation regarding the Jenkins setup is available as wiki links from the views mentioned above.

## Documentation Repository
