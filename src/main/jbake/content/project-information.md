## Mailing Lists

These are the mailing lists that have been established for this project. For each list, there is a subscribe, unsubscribe, and an archive link.

The Sling Users List is the preferred way of getting help with Sling. However, you can also [Ask a Sling question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=sling) if you prefer.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses JIRA a J2EE-based, issue tracking and project management application. Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following issue tracking system for this project.

The issue tracker can be found at [http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING](http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING)


## Source Repository

As of October 2017 the Sling source code has migrated to multiple GitHub repositories, synced to the canonical ASF Git repositories using the [ASF Git](https://gitbox.apache.org/) services.

All our repositories have `sling` in their name and are found under the `apache` organization, use [this search link](https://github.com/apache/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=sling) to find them.

As of October 19th this migration is not fully complete, see [SLING-3987](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SLING-3987) for details.


## Continuous Integration

Sling builds run automatically on the [ASF's Jenkins instance](https://builds.apache.org/), triggered
by commits.

We maintain multiple build jobs, typically one or two per module. These are grouped into two views:

* [Sling](https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling/), which holds all Sling-related jobs
* [Sling-Dashboard](https://builds.apache.org/view/S-Z/view/Sling-Dashboard/), which holds all Sling jobs needing attention, such as failed jobs.

More documentation regarding the Jenkins setup is available as wiki links from the views mentioned above.
