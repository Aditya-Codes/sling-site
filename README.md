sling-site/asf-site
-------------------
This is the asf-site branch of the sling-site repository.

It holds the content that's published on the Sling website.

Changes to that branch are automatically synced to http://sling.apache.org

If for some reason the http://sling.apache.org content is not updated after
pushing to this branch, make a minor edit in this file and push again to trigger
the sync process.
