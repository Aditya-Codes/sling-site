sling-site/asf-site
-------------------
This is the asf-site branch of the sling-site repository.

It holds the content that's published on the Sling website.

Changes to that branch are automatically synced to http://sling.apache.org

(with a /ng prefix for now, until this new site replaces the existing ASF CMS-based one)
